    AI offers reliability, cost- effectiveness, solve complicated problems, and make
    decisions; in addition, AI restrict data from getting lost. AI is applied nowadays
    in most fields whether business or engineering. One of the great tools in AI
    is called “reinforcement learning” which is based on testing success and failure
    in real life to increase the reliability of applications. Unfortunately, AI
    is limited with its capability and functionality. (“Sadek”,(n.d.)) Although
    Artificial Intelligence made our lives much easier and saved us more time than
    ever, scientists are predicting that by the huge dependency on AI humanity
    could extinct. Scientists argue that by having a AI machines, people will be
    jobless and that will conclude in losing the sense of living. Since machines
    are learning and doing thigs more efficiently and effectively in a timely manner,
    this could be the reason of our extinction
