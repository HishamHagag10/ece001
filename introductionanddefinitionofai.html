      <li> Introduction :I have chosen this topic to spotlight on one of the most technological
        trend these days known as AI (Artificial Intelligent).Therefore; I will
        discuss some of the most important aspects related to AI in which it will
        help in a better understanding of Artificial Intelligent and both its advantages
        and disadvantages to be able to protect ourselves from the upcoming technological
        trend. This paper will also discuss some of Applications of AI

        Definition :Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science . Much of the
        literature defines artificial intelligence as: “the study and design of
        intelligent customers. ” The intelligent customer is a system that understands
        its environment and takes positions that increase its chance of success
        in achieving its mission or team mission. This definition, in terms of
        goals, actions, perception, and environment is due to Russell & Norvig
        (2003) and other definitions also include knowledge and learning as additional
        criteria. Computer scientist John McCarthy originally coined the term in
        1956 , [1] and himself defined it as "the science and engineering of making
        intelligent machines". [2] Andreas Kaplan and Michael Heinlein define artificial
        intelligence as “the ability of a system to correctly interpret external
        data, learn from that data, and use that knowledge to achieve specific
        goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.”</li>
