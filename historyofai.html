    Artificial Intelligence was first proposed by John McCarthy in 1956 in his first
    academic conference on the subject. The idea of machines operating like human
    beings began to be the center of scientist’s mind and whether if it is possible
    to make machines have the same ability to think and learn by itself was introduced
    by the mathematician Alan Turing. Alan Turing was able to put his hypotheses
    and questions into actions by testing whether “machines can think”? After series
    of testing (later was called as Turing Test) it turns out that it is possible
    to enable machines to think and learn just like humans. Turing Test uses the
    pragmatic approach to be able to identify if machines can respond as humans
